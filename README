LIBVNA: Vector Network Analyzer Library
Copyright Â© 2020 D Scott Guthridge <scott-guthridge@rompromity.net>

Library for electrical vector network analyzers.  The library provides
functions for 12-error parameter (and other) VNA calibration, generalized
conversions between network parameter types, and loading and saving
network parameter data in Touchstone 1, Touchstone 2 and a native format.
Refer to the provided manual pages and examples.

Prerequisites:
    - You'll need a C99 level C compiler such as gcc or clang.

    - You'll need to install the libyaml development package:

	Fedora, RedHat, Centos
	    sudo yum install libyaml-devel

	Debian, Ubuntu
	    sudo apt-get install libyaml-dev

	If all else fails, download and build from source:
	    https://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML


Build, Test and Install:
    $ ./bootstrap	# If building from git; skip if building from tarball.
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make check
    # make install


If you have gnuplot installed, you can see an interesting example of
VNA calibration at work by running:
    $ make plot


To build RPM files:
    $ make srcrpm
    $ make rpms


The library is still undergoing some final development and hasn't had its
first official release yet.  While the version remains at 0.0, we may
break binary compatibility without reflecting it in the library version.

If you'd like to help, please contact me.  The main things I could use
help on right now are:

    - A review of the API
    	- Does it make sense?  Is it the right abstraction?
	- Does it allow for future extensions without breaking binary
	  compatibility.
	- What's missing?

    - A review of the code (almost 24000 lines of C99 code)

Finally, please make suggestions for how the library could be improved.
