== LIBVNA Examples ==

The example programs from the man pages are included here.

vnacal-example.c:
    Example of using the vnacal functions to calibrate a simulated
    imperfect vector network analyzer.  In this case, it's showing
    six-error term calibration.

    Build:
	cc -g -o vnacal-example vnacal-example.c -lvna -lyaml -lm

    Run:
	./vnacal-example > vnacal-example.out
	gnuplot vnacal-example.gnuplot

    In the plot, dashed lines are measured values, solid lines are the
    value corrected by calibration and points are calulated expected
    values (which as you can see, correctly lie on the solid lines).
    The S12 calibrated curve and expected points are not visible on
    the plot as they're exactly covered by the S21 calibrated curve and
    expected points.


vnaconv-example.c:
    Simple of example of converting a 2x2 s-parameter matrix to
    z-parameters.

    Build:
	cc -g -o vnaconv-example vnaconv-example.c -lvna -lm

    Run:
	./vnaconv-example


vnadata-example.c:
    Example of storing parameter data in a vnadata_t object and converting
    from z-parameters to s-parameters.

    Build:
	cc -g -o vnadata-example vnadata-example.c -lvna -lm

    Run:
	./vnadata-example


vnafile-example:
    Example of saving a 3x3 s-parameter matrix to a file.

    Build:
	cc -o vnafile-example vnafile-example.c -lvna -lm

    Run:
	./vnafile-example
