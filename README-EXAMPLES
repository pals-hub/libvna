== LIBVNA Examples ==

The example programs from the man pages are included here.

vnacal-example.c:
    Example of using the vnacal functions to calibrate a simulated
    imperfect vector network analyzer.  In this case, it's showing
    six-error term calibration.

    Build:
	cc -g -o vnacal-example vnacal-example.c -lvna -lyaml -lm

    Run:
	./vnacal-example > vnacal-example.out
	gnuplot vnacal-example.gnuplot

    In the plot, dashed lines are measured values, solid lines are the
    value corrected by calibration and points are calulated expected
    values (which as you can see, correctly lie on the solid lines).
    Notice that S11 is very far off before correction.  The S12 calibrated
    curve and expected points aren't visible in the figure as they're
    exactly covered by the S21 calibrated curve and expected points.


vnaconv-example.c:
    Simple of example of converting a 2x2 s-parameter matrix to
    z-parameters.

    Build:
	cc -g -o vnaconv-example vnaconv-example.c -lvna -lm

    Run:
	./vnaconv-example


vnadata-example.c:
    Example of storing parameter data in a vnadata_t object and converting
    from z-parameters to s-parameters.

    Build:
	cc -g -o vnadata-example vnadata-example.c -lvna -lm

    Run:
	./vnadata-example


vnafile-example:
    Program to convert between network parameter types and between
    touchstone and native file formats.

    Build:
	cc -o vnafile-example vnafile-example.c -lvna -lm

    Usage:
	./vnafile-example [-f format] input-file output-file
	Run with -\? for the full usage text.

    Convert the sample Touchstone 2 data file from S parameters
    to T parameters, saving in magnitude-angle format.

	./vnafile-example -f Tma vnafile-example.ts out.ts

    Convert from Touchstone 2 to Touchstone 1.

	./vnafile-example vnafile-example.ts out.s2p

    Convert the sample data file to insertion loss, return loss
    and VSWR, saving in native format.

	./vnafile-example -f IL,RL,VSWR vnafile-example.ts out.npd
